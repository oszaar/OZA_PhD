Repository for the thesis entitled "**Improving the Performance of Organic Thermoelectrics**". <br>
Defended on "March --- ---"

This repository aims to provide the data and scripts used to create the figures in the thesis. The creation of this repository is not a compulsory requirement for my Ph.D. dissertation but rather an effort to learn other tools to present, and keep track of my work. Consequently, the completion of this repository will likely be after the thesis defense.
